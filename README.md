Wingman was conceptualised by Aaron de Vroede and is being implemented in collaboration with his classmates Given Kibanza, Leo Steenkamp, Daniel Derbyshire and Saraja Gantner.

It is the final project of Le Wagon's Data Science Batch #1266.

# Problem
- There are many potential unforeseen abnormalities or complications during the course of a flight which can lead to devastating losses of human life if the flight crew are not fully prepared for the situation.

- Pilots currently rely on standard operating procedures (SOP’s), Evidence-Based Training (EBT) & personal experience to avoid incidents/accidents from developing.

- However… No flight is ever the same and always carries with it a unique set of potential hazards & risks which may be overlooked.

# Solution
- A prediction-based tool could be built by potentially using a multiclass classification model to provide invaluable predictions on the most likely emergency scenarios that may be encountered for a flight with a given set of details.

- This would be based on the analysis of an extensive dataset of features associated with past incidents & accidents.

# Data Source
- The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) provides an extensive database of past incidents & accidents from the start of 2008 to the end of May 2023.

- Additionally, further data (1982 - 2008) may be included from a separate database on the NTSB’s website if necessary.

# Emergency Scenario Prediction
- This approach lends itself well to the use of a machine learning model, wherein the extensive set of features associated with the database tables could be used as inputs to predict the most likely emergency scenarios that may be encountered for a flight with given details.

- Predictions of emergencies which have a high risk of the aircraft being destroyed, or of there being a large number of fatalities if an accident were to occur, could be highlighted in this manner.
